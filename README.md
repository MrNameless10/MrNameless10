# Miguel Ângelo Freitas

Hi! 👋😊 I'm Miguel Ângelo and I'm a student at University of Minho, where I'm getting a degree in Computer Science 👨‍💻.

## About me 👀

I was born and raised in Caldas das Taipas 🇵🇹, a small village in Guimarães, where I currently live. I study in Braga @ Uminho.

I also have a band called "GASPEA" where I'm the drummer, you can follow our work [Here](https://linktr.ee/gaspea "GASPEA linktree"), we have already went to Paredes de Coura to record.

I love music 🎵 , chess ♟️ and pizza 🍕(Like ninja turtle 🐱‍👤), among other things. I'm a bit of an introvert, during my alone time I like to play drums, play some video games 🎮, study some html.

Núcleo de Estudantes de Ciências da Computação [NECC] is a group of students, volunteers, who represent and help all students of the Computer Science Degree course at the University of Minho. I'm trying to create a better community and doing my best to help new students facing new problems, so I decided to join [NECC] to help them and improve my self skills, like learning code, learning what type of code do you use in real life, trying to know what do you need to be a good Computer Science worker 🤖. I'm developer at [@NECC](https://github.com/NECC), you can join our community [HERE](http://bit.ly/DiscordLCC).
